  <h1>Chicken</h1>
  <p>
    <b>The chicken</b>(Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated junglefowl
    species, with attributes of wild species such as the grey and the Ceylon
    junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock
    is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a
    cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird
    is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Originally raised</b> or cockfighting or for special ceremonies,
    chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd
    centuries BC).[2][3] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of
    food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.
